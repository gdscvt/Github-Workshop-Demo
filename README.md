 ## Github Terminology 🤓
 
 > clone => Clones a Git repository to a specified directory. Changes made to the cloned repo (laptop)
 >              can then be pushed (or branched off) to the original repo (on Github). This means the ownership
 >              of the repo is still the original creator.
 
 > fork => Like git clone, creates a copy of the repository. However, the copy made is now seperated
 >         from the original owner. Changes made to the repo is only made to the repo copy, and not
 >         to the original owner's repo.
